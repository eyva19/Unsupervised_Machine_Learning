### What is the best value for k?
The optimal value for k is 4, since after 4 inertia starts decreasing at a slower rate.

### What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?
The total explained variance of the three principal components is approximately 0.895. The explained variance is a measure of how much of the variation in the data is explained by the principal components. In this case, the three principal components explain approx. 89.5% of the variation in the data.

### What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?
The best value for k is 4
### Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?
No, it does not differ from the best k value found using the original data. In both cases the best k value is 4

### After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
1. When the number of features is reduced, it might be easier to visualize the clustering results in lower-dimensional space, which can help in understanding the relationships between clusters.
2. Using fewer features can also speed up the computation time for clustering. Using fewer features can result in clusters that are simpler and more easily separable. This can make it easier to interpret the clusters and understand the patterns in the data.
3. However, using fewer features might lead to a loss of information. Some features might be important for distinguishing between clusters and removing them could lead to less accurate clustering.
